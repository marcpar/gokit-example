# Hex to RGB

A go lang tool for transforming hex to awesome human readable color.

note:
I use gokit for a microservice framework

## Installation

To run the service theres a makefile involve.

Requirements:
   * docker
   * docker-compose
   * build-essentials

installation to run make
```bash

sudo apt-get install build-essential
```    

there are 2 dockerfile since I dont have registry to push the development to improve developer expirience:

   - dockerfile.dev
      here watcher is installed for developer exp
   - dockerfile
      its using scratch image and alpine as a builder for the final product


Use the Force!! sorry its _**make**_


```bash
# to buid images
make build
# to run developer mode
make dev
# to run test
make test
# to cleanup
make clean
# to push to registry (not currently active)
make push


```
